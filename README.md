## Usage

Open the link to the deployed page here here: [Link](https://text-editor-pwa-u0t5.onrender.com)

It may take a moment to load at first if it has not been used for a while. You can enter and edit text as you please. When the tab loses focus, it will save the current text to the database. If you close the tab and return to it at another point, it will load the text. You can also click the install button to use it outside of the browser. It also can function when offline, as long as it has been loaded at least once while online.
